The situations that specialists undertake are exclusively surveillance of unfaithful spouses or fraudsters, investigation of murders.</p>
<p>This image has developed in the minds of people thanks to detective series and popular literature, in which the image of the detective is embellished, and the sharpness of his work is exaggerated.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong>an agency, a private detective</strong> deal with risk, must have the appropriate permits and character qualities to do their job. But let's look at the profession of a detective realistically.</p>
A private detective is a specialist who clarifies situations that a person cannot solve on his own or he lacks assistance from law enforcement agencies. It is the qualified knowledge of the detective in the field of conducting investigative activities, law, psychology that helps to speed up the resolution of issues.</p>
</div>
<h2 class=""subheader"">What does an agency, a private detective do?</h2>
<p>The field of activity of the detective is huge. It is divided into categories that involve different types of services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for people (relatives, old friends, colleagues; deceased; debtors, fraudsters).</li>
<li>Search for movable and immovable property (presence of hidden bank accounts, business abroad, cars and houses).</li>
<li>Search for stolen or missing items (cars, jewelry, etc.).</li>
<li>Collecting and verifying information (determining the owner of the phone, checking the company for fraud, establishing marital status or how nannies treat children in the absence of parents, etc.).</li>
<li>Investigation of criminal and administrative crimes (murder, theft, abuse of official position, etc.).</li>
<li>Representation in negotiations (participation in business conversations, ensuring the safety of the customer).</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">You can contact the <strong>agency to a private detective </strong> with instructions to find out the place of residence of the person of interest, establish his identity, order an independent investigation on charges of a crime, identify corporate espionage. The agency can collect reliable information, verify the authenticity of the available data.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">Don't be afraid to entrust your problem to professionals</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is outsiders with professional knowledge who are best able to understand the current state of affairs. You can contact your friends or apply to the ""authorities"" and expect the results. There is another option – to attract an experienced specialist, an independent expert to your side.</p>
<p>In some cases, cooperation with a detective is the best option. For example, when you suspect a missing person and do not want to wait 3 days, as prescribed by law for law enforcement agencies. When you doubt the objectivity or competence of the specialists of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. When you need to get information quickly and confidentially.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>an agency and a private detective</strong> are a real help in modern society, when ""trust, but check"" is an actual folk wisdom.</p>

The experience of a <strong>private detective in finding a person</strong> plays a key role, so you can count on for highly qualified assistance.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">Why do people disappear</h2>
<p>The search for a missing relative, friend, classmate, colleague, fellow traveler are common requests in the practice of detectives. The reasons for the loss of communication are very different:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Unwillingness to communicate due to conflict;
  </li>
  <li>
    Did not consider it necessary to warn about the new address of residence;
  </li>
  <li>
    Loss of communication due to lack of communication for a long time;
  </li>
  <li>        
    A disease that provokes blackouts in memory;
  </li>
  <li>
    Getting to the hospital or the police because of an unexpected situation;
  </li>
  <li>
    Exchanged contacts that were accidentally lost;
  </li>
  <li>
    Death.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to exclude unlikely causes and choose a method for <strong>searching for lost connections</strong>, the detective conducts a detailed conversation with the customer. Experience and professional intuition allow <strong>a private detective to find a person</strong> to determine the most effective ways.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">What questions are addressed</h2>
<p>Detectives are needed not only for the <strong> search for an unexpectedly missing relative</strong>. You can contact us for the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Restoring ties with distant relatives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determination of the place of residence and work of a friend, colleague.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establishing the marital status of an acquaintance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It happens that we get a call about the <strong>search for a deceased relative</strong> during WWII. Customers want to find out about the place of his burial, find loved ones to communicate with.</p>
<p>The disappearance of a person is always a sensitive topic, because the results can be unpredictable, up to the news of death. We understand that we can <strong> search for an already deceased relative</strong>, so we make every effort to provide professional, operational and psychological assistance.</p>

<p>Opinion of the practitioner</p>
<p>In the article you will learn about the activities of a professional private detective:</strong> who works in this profession, what they face, what skills they have so that the work is carried out at a high level and gives results.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">Who works as a professional private detective</h2>
<p>The work of a detective consists in a complex of investigative measures that can be competently organized only by people who have professional experience behind their backs, ingenuity, strong–willed character, physically developed - ""opera detectives"".</p>
<p>To open a detective agency in Russia, it is necessary to work in the internal affairs bodies for at least 5 years in the criminal investigation department. Do not have a criminal record, do not be registered in dispensaries. A plus is a higher legal education, passing a special course <strong> ""professional private detective"".</strong></p>
<p>A prerequisite for the legal work of a detective is obtaining a license. It is issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a period of 5 years. At the same time, the detective registers business activity in the Federal Tax Service.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">The basis of detective work is the organization of the process</h2>
<p>The work of a detective requires ingenuity and creativity. Proper organization of events, flexibility of planning, the ability to look at the situation outside the box, physical endurance affect the final result of the work. The evaluation of the customer and, accordingly, the payment depends on this.</p>
<p>It happens that the customer wants to participate in monitoring, searching for a person or collecting information. We understand his interest. But the ethics of a professional private detective </strong> does not allow revealing the methodology – this is not a game.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">Ready for unexpected turns</h2>
<p>Detective work involves stress tolerance and communication skills with people:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer comes with a classic situation, but during the investigation it acquires an individual character, nuances appear that make the case delicate.</li>
<li>We have to work with types of people of different ages, with men and women, adults and children. You can't do without knowledge of psychology here.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are cases when <strong>a professional private detective</strong> reveals completely unexpected results. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wife suspected her husband of cheating with a woman, it turned out – cheating with a man.</li>
<li>An influential businessman went bankrupt. I thought it was the machinations of competitors, but in fact it turned out to be the betrayal of my best friend-companion.</li>
<li>The reason for the leak of information from the company was not colleagues, but bugs installed everywhere by the cleaner.</li>
<li>The children of the elderly mother did not believe her that someone periodically rings the apartment door. It turned out that a neighbor was having fun over the old lady when he was drinking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""subheader"">The myth of detective work</h2>
<p>There is an opinion in society that the main part of the detective's work is surveillance, especially for unfaithful spouses. Yes, we are also doing this. According to statistics, 70% of requests come from women, the remaining 30% – from men, parents of grown-up children.</p>
<p>We also perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for missing people;</li>
<li>Search for cars, property;</li>
<li>Criminal investigations of various categories: from theft to murder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A professional private detective </strong>, thanks to the ability to search and find, performs various tasks. Particularly complex cases are conducted with the involvement of highly specialized experts.</p>
<h2 class=""subheader"">Why the profession of a private detective will always be relevant</h2>
<p>Every day people face problems or incomprehensible situations. Due to circumstances, not everyone can share their suspicions and fears with their loved ones and friends. Contacting the police, who already have enough to do, seems to be completely losing.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is <strong>professional private detectives</strong> who are a real help in solving problems. Yes, they are also different, so choose those detectives to whom you can entrust your secret or a delicate assignment.</p>
<h4 class=""uk-h4"">Detective Agency and fraudsters</h4>
<p>Pay attention! The ethics of a professional private detective</strong> obliges him to always indicate his license number. Most often, the number is placed next to the contacts – on the website and business card. This is necessary so that the customer could protect himself from a fraudster or an unscrupulous detective at the first stage, who for various reasons did not extend the right to search activity after 5 years.</p>
<p>Also, the specialist provides the original (not a copy!) licenses and a detective's certificate at a personal meeting. Therefore, most often scammers avoid meetings, have a conversation on the phone. In order to gain the trust of the customer, clone sites of reputable detective agencies are created.</p>
<p>Be careful! The authenticity of the website of the agency ""Pravo"" can be identified at: https://право18.рф Our detectives always present the original license and the detective's certificate.</p>

How difficult is the bread of a professional detective </b>? Who can become a private investigator? We will try to answer these questions below.</p>
<p>Let's start, as introduced, with the letter of the law. In order to open their own detective agency in our country, the applicant must have served in the internal affairs bodies for at least five years in operational positions or as an investigator. This is explained quite simply: it is these people who are best acquainted with the system of operational investigative measures that form the basis of the work of a private detective agency.</p>","<p><b>Detective agency</b>… Recently, this phrase has become more and more firmly part of our daily life. How difficult is the bread of a <b>professional detective </b>? Who can become a private investigator? We will try to answer these questions below.</p>
<p>Let's start, as introduced, with the letter of the law. In order to open their own detective agency in our country, the applicant must have served in the internal affairs bodies for at least five years in operational positions or as an investigator. This is explained quite simply: it is these people who are best acquainted with the system of operational investigative measures that form the basis of the work of a private detective agency.</p>
<p>In addition, those who decide to become a private investigator,</b> should not have any problems with the law in the past and be registered in various specialized medical institutions. The license of a private investigator itself is issued for a period of five years, followed by an extension for the same period, at the same time a new detective agency is registered with the relevant tax authority.</p>
<p>What does this mean? That customers of private <b>detective agencies</b> need to <strong> be sure to ask for a license for the right to carry out detective work from a detective</strong> before entrusting their business and financial resources to him. Real detectives, as a rule, immediately provide all the necessary documents.</p>
<p>Another important point to keep in mind. The activity of a private detective is in many ways similar to the work of a creative person. And the outcome and the amount of payment largely depends on how this or that search event will be organized. It is highly discouraged for customers to participate in the detective's work process, as this contradicts not only ethics but, at times, jeopardizes the safety of the customer himself.</p>
<p>The activities that fall within the circle of interests of a professional detective </b> are very extensive. This includes the establishment of the facts of adultery, and the search for missing people and property, assistance in the investigation of criminal cases, and so on. It is not uncommon for a private investigator to act as a professional psychologist, helping the customer to correctly perceive the truth revealed during the investigation.</p>
<p>Summing up, we can say: it is certainly worth contacting private detectives. Of course, there are different people among them. But if a professional detective has all the necessary documents, if he listens to the customer with attention and tries to immediately delve into the problem, then we can say with confidence: this person has successfully passed his thorny path to the profession and not in vain ate his bread in a difficult service. This means that they will definitely help you.</p>",63-what-does-a-professional-private-detective-do,61-legal-verification-of-real-estate-car-detective-s-help,

We will find out whether the owner's documents are in order, whether the property is secured in a bank and other hidden information.</p>
<p>Checking the cleanliness of real estate – confidence in the acquisition</p>
<p>Scams with the sale of houses, apartments, office space and land plots are one of the most common problems not only in Russia, but all over the world. Such transactions are expensive and require knowledge of legal nuances. For scammers who deal with uninformed people, there are plenty of loopholes for deception.</p>
<p>Some of the popular schemes:</p>
<p>Sale of property that is pledged to the bank or arrested.</p>
<p>The real owner of the property is not aware of the sale or against it.</p>
<p>Developers offer to invest in the construction of a residential building, but legally they do not exist or they have problems with the law.</p>
<p><strong>Checking the legal purity of real estate</strong> is a mandatory stage when making a purchase, lease. This is the task of lawyers who prepare purchase and sale or lease agreements. But in real life, people who buy an apartment on the secondary market (as an example) are limited to a standard contract from the Internet, in which the clause that the housing is not under arrest, pledged, etc. is taken on faith. If we are talking about developers, few people check companies. And then unpleasant situations happen in which a lot of money is lost.</p>
<p>To avoid this, be sure to check the property! Private detectives of the Pravo agency will help you:</p>
<p>Let's check the information about the seller of real estate, about the developer.</p>
<p>We examine the documents provided by the owner.</p>
