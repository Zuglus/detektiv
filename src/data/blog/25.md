### Legal Verification of Real Estate and Cars Before Purchase

Are you planning to buy property? Thinking of investing in an off-plan apartment or making an exchange? Renting an expensive office? We offer fraud protection with comprehensive legal checks of real estate and cars. Our detectives will verify the seller’s documentation, check for any mortgages or liens on the property, and uncover other hidden information.

### Property Verification – Confidence in Your Purchase

Real estate fraud is a common issue not only in Russia but worldwide. Such transactions involve significant sums of money and require knowledge of legal nuances. For fraudsters, loopholes abound when dealing with uninformed buyers.

Some common schemes include:  

- Selling property under a bank lien or court seizure.  
- Selling property without the owner’s knowledge or against their will.  
- Developers offering investments in non-existent or legally troubled projects.

Verifying the legal status of a property is an essential step when buying or renting. While lawyers are typically responsible for preparing sales or rental contracts, many individuals purchasing property on the secondary market rely on standard online templates, often assuming that the property is free from liens, arrests, or encumbrances.
