A family from a Russian city contacted the **Detective Agency of Grozny Eduard Nikolayevich**, seeking help in locating relatives who had been living in Ukraine. For the past **five years**, they had no contact with their relatives, which caused great concern among the family. They didn’t know what had happened to them and worried about whether their loved ones were alive, how they were doing, and what conditions they were living in.

The situation was challenging, as communication with certain regions of Ukraine was heavily restricted at the time. This made any attempt to find out what had happened to the relatives more complicated. However, our team of detectives took on the case, understanding how important it was to **reconnect lost family ties**.

### Initial Information

According to the information provided by the family, the relatives had been living in a Ukrainian city, leading ordinary lives, working, and making plans for the future. However, over the years, all contact was lost, and no one knew what had happened to them. The family tried various ways to re-establish contact, but to no avail. That’s when they decided to seek our help.

### Investigation Plan

Our detectives began by gathering information about the relatives' last known residence and workplace. We analyzed available data on their movements, potential address changes, and known contacts. Both open and restricted databases were thoroughly checked to understand what might have happened.

After several weeks of meticulous analysis and searching, we discovered that the relatives had moved to another city in a different region of Ukraine. This news came as a surprise to our clients, who had no idea that their relatives had relocated.

### New Information

In the new city, the relatives had purchased an apartment and found new jobs, confirming that they were alive, well, and continuing with their lives. Most importantly, our detectives were able to establish contact with them and convey a message from their Russian relatives.

The reaction was joyful and emotional. **The Ukrainian relatives** not only confirmed that everything was fine but also expressed great happiness knowing that their family cared about them. Both sides were thrilled to reconnect after so many years.

### Conclusion

Our team completed the investigation by providing contact details to both parties, successfully helping to restore family ties that had been lost for **five years**. The family from Russia expressed their gratitude for the work done and for the help in finding their relatives.
