A successful businesswoman approached us, concerned about finding the perfect candidates for the roles of housekeeper and caretaker for her luxurious home. As expected, both candidates had impeccable references. Their resumes looked flawless at first glance: extensive experience, excellent reviews, and even recommendations from previous employers that seemed completely convincing. But as the saying goes, **all that glitters is not gold**.

We began by checking the documents and background of each candidate. The potential housekeeper, indeed, had decent recommendations and appeared to be an exemplary candidate, perfectly suited for a prestigious household. However, upon a deeper investigation, it was revealed that this individual **was wanted by the authorities**. The reason? **He had been evading child support payments** for many years! Multiple enforcement proceedings had been initiated against him for unpaid child support, and he had been hiding from the law. It was clear that such a person could not be trusted with either the home or the close ones of our client. And while the situation seemed serious enough, things escalated even further.

The second candidate, who also appeared to be an ideal choice for the housekeeper position, turned out to be an even more intriguing figure. During the investigation, we found that she was **burdened with enormous debts to banks**. She had taken out loans but, by all indications, had no intention of repaying them. These debts weren’t just a few thousand rubles; they amounted to hundreds of thousands. **Her financial situation** was disastrous, which already raised questions about her reliability.

But that wasn’t all. Digging into her employment history, our detectives discovered that at several previous jobs, she had been fired for **kleptomania**. Yes, she had been caught **stealing personal belongings from her employers**. The housekeeper had tried her best to hide her past, hoping no one would look into it. However, our agency’s professional approach left her no chance of escaping scrutiny.

Situations like this are not uncommon. Often, candidates for such positions hide behind glowing references and forged documents, concealing their troubled past. As you can see, even the most seemingly ideal candidate can turn out to be highly unreliable and even dangerous. **This isn’t playing with fire — it’s a direct threat to your property and safety**.

We strongly advise against taking risks and always **verify your potential staff through our agency**. Our professional detectives will conduct thorough investigations, dive into the details, and uncover all the information candidates would rather hide. We will help you protect your family, property, and reputation from the potential risks posed by dishonest workers.

**Trust only verified individuals with the safety of your home**. We, on our part, guarantee a meticulous background check on every candidate, ensuring that you can trust those to whom you entrust what matters most.
