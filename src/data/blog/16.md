Theft at work is not uncommon, and one such case brought employees of a small grocery store to the **Detective Agency of Grozny Eduard Nikolayevich**. They were concerned about the regular disappearance of revenue.

### Suspicion Within the Team

Every evening after work, the **shift supervisor** would collect the day’s revenue and store it in the shop’s safe. Although the daily earnings were relatively modest — ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 rubles — the money accumulated over the week and was handed over as a lump sum. That’s when the strange shortfall was discovered. Only two people had access to the safe: the store’s director and the shift supervisor. However, the director showed little interest in investigating the situation, leaving the employees puzzled. As a result, they collectively decided to turn to the **private detectives at our agency** for help.

### Situation Analysis

Our team began by analyzing all the circumstances and studying the backgrounds of the store’s employees. The psychological profile of the potential culprit didn’t match the descriptions provided by the staff, leading us to look for other suspects.

At first glance, everything seemed logical: access to the safe was restricted, and the circle of suspects was small. However, our experience suggests that **even the most unexpected scenarios cannot be ruled out**.

### Investigation and Surprising Findings

For two weeks, our detectives monitored the store’s employees, trying to figure out who could be stealing the money and how. One of the key individuals who came under our scrutiny was the **cleaning lady**. She was not officially employed by the store but had a spotless reputation and had long been above suspicion.

However, during our surveillance, we learned that she was living with a man who had previously been convicted of theft. This led us to suspect her involvement. It turned out that the cleaning lady had made a **mold of the keys** to the safe and passed it to her partner, who in turn created a duplicate. Each time she cleaned the director’s office, her accomplice would **steal part of the revenue**, working discreetly and carefully. They waited an entire week before acting, so as not to arouse suspicion among the staff.

### Conclusion of the Investigation

Thanks to the **thorough and coordinated efforts** of our agency’s detectives, we were able to identify who was behind the thefts. We gathered all the necessary evidence and handed it over to the clients, allowing the culprits to be held accountable. The employees not only secured themselves against further theft but also restored trust within the team, knowing that the thefts were the work of outsiders, not their colleagues.

This case once again proves that detectives can be approached not only for personal matters but also for issues related to your business or workplace relationships.
